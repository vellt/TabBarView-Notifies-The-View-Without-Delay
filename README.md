# TabBarView notifies the View without delay⏱️

I encountered an interesting problem during a project, with many open issues on the Web, such as: 

- [TabController notifies correct index with a delay (after the tab scroll animation ends) #88875](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/88875)
 
- [TabController listener triggers with delay on swipe #89371](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/89371)

I demonstrate the ability of TabBarView to notify the view with the correct index without delay. ✅ <br>
Documentation in the [the rows of the code](https://github.com/vellt/TabBarView-Notifies-The-View-Without-Delay/blob/main/lib/main.dart). ✍️ Here is a **preview GIF**, where you can see, how it works:
